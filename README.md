# ATM Management System

## Overview

- **Cash Deposit**: Deposit cash into the bank account.
- **Mini Statement**: Generate a mini statement of the last transactions.
- **Transfer Balance**: Transfer funds to another bank account using a 16-digit account number.

- **Balance Enquiry**: Displays the current balance.
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Allows the user to withdraw a specified amount from the account.
